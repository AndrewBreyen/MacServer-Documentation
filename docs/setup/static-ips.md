# Static IPs

A static IP address assignment on your modem ensures that specific devices connected to your network always have the same IP address.

A static IP is required for these devices:

| Device | IP Address |
| --- | --- |
| MacServer | 192.168.4.100 |
| Home Assistant | 192.168.4.101  |
| Pihole* | 192.168.4.105 |
| Phoscon | 192.168.4.150 |

(* may need to be set locally on ubuntu server, depending on your router. See [linuxconfig.org article for directions](https://linuxconfig.org/change-ip-address-on-ubuntu-server))
