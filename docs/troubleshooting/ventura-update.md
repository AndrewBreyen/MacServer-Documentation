## Virtualbox Aborted with Exit Code 1

Error Text:
````
Failed to open a session for the virtual machine PiHole.

The virtual machine 'PiHole' has terminated unexpectedly during startup with exit code 1 (0x1).

Result Code: NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005)
Component: MachineWrap
````

Solution 1: 
VirtualBox 7 was recently released (Oct 10, updated Oct 20), which is MUCH better than version 6

Download latest version from [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

Use the uninstaller first, then install version 7. 

The PiHole VM may need to be re-added. Attempt to re-add. If issues persist, try solution 2. 


Solution 2: 

1. Open Terminal
2. Enter commands:
````
sudo su
csrutil clear
reboot
````
3. Verify if the issue persists by attempting to re-start the VM in headless mode. If it does not, stop troubleshooting. Otherwise, continue. 
4. Download the latest release from [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and use `VirtualBox_Uninstall.tool` to un-install VirtualBox
5. Reboot
6. Re-install Virtualbox using the downloaded installer. 
7. If prompted, go to System Preferences - Privacy - General and accept the extensions
8. If the PiHole VM is no longer listed in VirtualBox, re-add PiHole Virtual Machine `PiHole.vbox` file using the 'Add' button in VirtualBox
8. Reboot

## Full Disk Access/Privacy/Other Permissions

macOS Ventura seems to use a different scheme for Privacy, and some apps may not be updated for it. 

If required, remove permissions that are requested. 

If issues persist, uninstall and reinstall the app.
